(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Oh

(Magic)

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Whoa, my love
My darling
I've hungered, hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?
My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years
You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
(Oh, yeah, yeah)

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known (Oh, yeah, yeah)

You smiled, you smiled
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last


Ooh, ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

God only knows what I'd be without you

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you 
(What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you

Made off
Don't stray
My kind's your kind
I'll stay the same
Pack up
Don't stray

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you


I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

La ta ta ta ta ta ta (History)
Hmm-mm-mm (Biology)
Whoa, la ta ta ta ta ta ta (Science book)
Hmm-mm-mm (French I took)

Yeah, but I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
 (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin 'bout, talkin 'bout my girl
Ooh, my girl
That's all I can talk about is my girl
Why don't you believe she's all my girl

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be
Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world
When a man loves a woman...

(I say a little prayer for you)
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (Makeup)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
And while I'm combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now (Wear now)
I say a little (Prayer for you)

(Forever) Forever, (And ever) yeah
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, (And ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, (Together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)

I run for the bus, dear
But while riding I think of us, dear (Us, dear)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time (Break time)
I say a little (Prayer for you)

(Forever) Forever, (And ever) and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, (And ever) and ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, (Together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)
Nobody but me

(Forever) Forever, (and ever) ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, (and ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, (together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)

My darling, believe me (Believe me)
For me, there is no one but you
Please love me true
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)
Say you'll love me true (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)

Say you'll love me true (Answer my prayer, baby)
This is my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)

Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
To break this circle that has been placed around me
From time to time, I find I've lost some need
That was so urgent to myself, I do believe

Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One? (Plug One)
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak?
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two (Is Plug Two)
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true (True)

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul (Soul)
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing (In full swing)
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

I know I'll love you better

It's I again, and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
"Let the wedding begin" (The wedding begin)
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're deaf
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

I know I'll love you better

Are the stars out tonight?
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)

(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

I... I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I... I was standing
You were there

But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

Come with me, my love
To the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

I lie in my bed — totally still
My eyes wide open — I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen!
This wasn't supposed to happen!
Ég og hann, ég og hann við segjum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til
Ég og hann, ég og hann við segjum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til

I lie in my bed — totally still
My eyes wide open — I'm in rapture
I'm in rapture
You've put a seed inside me
Oh, and while you're away
Seed
It's growing silently
To be a life
Starts in my stomach
Embraces my insides
Inside
And about to reach my heart
This wasn't supposed to happen!
This wasn't supposed to happen!
Ég og hann, ég og hann við segjum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til
Ég og hann, ég og hann við bítum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til
This really hurts
Ég og hann, ég og hann við bítum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til
Ég og hann, ég og hann við bítum
Ég og hann, ég og hann við finnum til

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be

The book of love is long and boring
And written very long ago
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
And things we're all too young to know

But I, I love it when you give me things
And you, you ought to give me wedding rings
I, I love it when you give me things
And you, you ought to give me wedding rings
Part I

If there's a remedy

Bound

Uh-huh, honey

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
 
(
Uh-huh, honey
)

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (
Bound to fall in love
)
Bound (
Bound to fall in love
)
Uh-huh, honey

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Feels like fire
I'm so in love with you
Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay, bad at bay
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away
I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down, I'll be around
With my undying, death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling love, flowers
And pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushin', rushin' inside of me
The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
This time, we go sublime
Lovers entwine, divine, divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure
I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
The power of love
A force from above
A sky-scraping dove
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal
I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
The very thought of you
And I forget to do
Those little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

Hello, I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Because I want to be your boyfriend
Hey, little girl
I want to be your boyfriend
Sweet little girl
I want to be your boyfriend

Hey, little girl
I want to be your boyfriend (Oh, I wanna be your boyfriend)
Sweet little girl
I want to be your boyfriend
 (Oh, I wanna be your boyfriend)
Hey, little girl
I want to be your boyfriend (Oh, I wanna be your boyfriend)
Sweet little girl
I want to be your boyfriend
 (Oh, I wanna be your boyfriend)

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Cherish
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Cherish your strength (You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy, keep giving me all your joy) Can't get away, I won't let you
Perish the thought (You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy, keep giving me all your joy) I could never forget to

Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish your strength (You're givin' it)
(You're givin' it to me boy) (Can't get away, can't get away)
(Keep giving me all your joy)
Perish the thought (You're givin' it)
(You're givin' it to me boy) (Can't get away, can't get away)
(Keep giving me all your joy)
Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you)

Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care

Daydreaming (Thinking of you)

Day—
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame
I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh
Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming, ah
An eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming, ah
Is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love make me feel ten feet tall (Yeah)
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing matters at all

These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still, there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
See, nothing even matters (Yeah)
See, nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me

You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously (Baby, baby)
'Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Said it don't matter, baby, baby
Don't matter

Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
'Cause nothing even matters no more
(No more, no more, no more)
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
No, no more

To me, to me, to me, to me
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me
(FREESTYLE SINGING TO END)

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

(You) You make me (Make me)
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
Uh, uh

Acha-ooh!

The way you make me 
fee-hee!
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, babe (Hee!)
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
The way you make me feel
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
You really turn me on
Hee-hee!
You knock me off of my feet
Hee-hee! Ooh!
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl! Aaow!
My lonely days are gone

The way you make me feel (Hee-hee!)
(Hee-hee-hee!)

You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl

You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl!
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet

La, la, la, la, take me home
Honey (Mother), I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park, through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls
I been everywhere with you 
(that's true)
Laugh until we think 
we'll die,
 barefoot on a 
summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree, like it's only 
you and me
Geez, you're something to see

La, la, la, la take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home
[Bridge: Jade & 
Alexander
 (spoken)]
Jade?
Alexander?
Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
I sure do ‒ you came jumping out after me!
Well, you fell on the concrete and nearly broke you ass
And you were bleeding all over the place
And I rushed you out to the hospital
You remember that?
Yes, I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the back seat
Smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you
And I never told you 'til just now!
Aww!

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
(Oh home)
 Home
(Oh home)
 Home
Home is wherever I'm with you
(Oh home)
 Home
(Oh home)
 Home
Home is when I'm alone with you
